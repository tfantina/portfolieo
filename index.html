        <p>
          Served as Co-founder and CTO building a web-app to help Brazilian Students choose their professors
          and discuss their university experience. I learned Rails through the process of building this
          application.

          I developed the minimum viable product that allowed users to add their professors, post reviews
          and aggregate ratings. Any review could be flagged for inappropriate content. For administration
          I built a portal for moderators to go in and review and remove flagged content.

        <p>
          Worked closely with the founder designing a minimum viable product based on their initial
          ideas and specifications. The application is designed to help Court Reporters manage their
          transcripts, set deadlines, budget their time and workload. I was the lead designer on the
          product and took the design from the initial stages all the way to the handoff with the developer.
          Throughout development I continued to consult on design issues.

        <p>
          After the initial launch I was asked to return to add additional features informed by user feedback.
          This gave me a unique opportunity to reaches my original designs and make changes almost a year later.

        <h2>Bocce</h2>
        <p>In the wake of the negative press some unnamed social networks have been facing I've been working
          on creating a new kind of open source social network called "Bocce". My goals are modest: I'd like
          to get a few hundred core users who can provide regular feedback and help me iterate on the design
          and feature set.
        </p>
        <p>Perhaps more than anything else, Bocce is a place where I can dream up crazy new features
          and build them, learn new Rails patterns and best practices and implement whatever tech into the
          stack that I want. One such feature is "Titlecased Posts" the first 100 characters of automatically
          become the title of the post (I'll be implementing a regular expression to make sure that words are
          not truncated) become the title; however if a post is more like a Tweet or a status update and is less
          than 100 characters it will be pushed out as such without the long form text box ever appearing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bocce is still in it's infancy. But as I have more time in the near future and learn more about testing
          in Rails will be implementing more features in the new year. I'm hoping to implement some really novel
          features with friendship relations to ensure that your circle stays fall, an elegant front end with React,
          and messaging capabilities.
